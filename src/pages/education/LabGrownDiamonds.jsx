              Lab-grown diamonds, also known as synthetic or cultured diamonds,
              are diamonds that are created in a laboratory setting rather than
              being formed through natural geological processes. These diamonds
              have the same physical, chemical, and optical properties as
              natural diamonds but are produced under controlled conditions in a
              laboratory.
            </p>

            <p>
              It's important to note that the term "lab-grown" or "synthetic"
              should not be confused with "simulant" diamonds, which are
              materials like cubic zirconia or moissanite that may look like
              diamonds but have different chemical compositions.
            </p>

            <p>
              As technology continues to advance, lab-grown diamonds are
              becoming increasingly popular and widely accepted in the jewelry
              market. They offer consumers an alternative that aligns with
              ethical, environmental, and budgetary considerations without
              compromising on the beauty and brilliance of a diamond.

                <h4>Tips for Accurate Measurement :</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Measure your ring size in the evening when your fingers are
                    warm, as they tend to be slightly larger than in the
                    morning.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Ensure the ring sizer or paper/string is snug but not too
                    tight.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Consider the size of the knuckle; the ring needs to slide
                    over the knuckle comfortably.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Measure your ring size in the evening when your fingers are
                    slightly larger due to increased blood flow. This can result
                    in a more accurate measurement.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Finger size can vary with temperature. Measure your ring
                    size when your fingers are at a normal, comfortable
                    temperature.
                  </li>
                  <li>Use Common Objects :</li>
                  <li>
                    Keep in mind that wider rings may feel tighter than narrow
                    ones, so you may need a slightly larger size for wider
                    bands.
                  </li>
