                  with the original documentation. Make sure to cross out/cover
                  old shipping addresses or bar codes. If you do not have the
                  original packaging, please include the ring/jewelry box inside
                  a small FedEx Priority box and seal it. Place the small FedEx
                  Priority box inside a medium FedEx Priority box.
