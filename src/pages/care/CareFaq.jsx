        <div className="composition-common composition">
          <h4>Composition :</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              White Gold: It is an alloy of gold mixed with other white metals,
              such as nickel, palladium, or silver. The gold content is measured
              in karats, with 14k and 18k being common for jewelry.
            </li>

            <li>
              Platinum: It has a naturally white color that does not fade or
              tarnish over time. Platinum jewelry does not require rhodium
              plating.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="composition-common density-and-weight">
          <h4>Density and Weight :</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              White Gold: It is less dense than platinum, so white gold jewelry
              may feel lighter compared to a similar piece made of platinum.
            </li>
            <li>
              Platinum : It is denser and heavier than white gold. Platinum
              jewelry tends to be more substantial.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="composition-common durability">
          <h4>Durability</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              White Gold : It can be more prone to scratches and wear over time.
              The rhodium plating on white gold jewelry may wear off, requiring
              re-plating to maintain its white appearance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Platinum: It is known for its durability and resistance to wear.
              Platinum jewelry is less likely to scratch or show signs of aging.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="composition-common hypoallergenic-properties">
          <h4>Hypoallergenic Properties :</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              White Gold: Some people may be allergic to the nickel present in
              some white gold alloys. However, there are nickel-free white gold
              options available.
            </li>
            <li>
              Platinum: It is generally hypoallergenic and suitable for people
              with sensitive skin.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="composition-common cost">
          <h4>Cost :</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              White Gold: It is often less expensive than platinum due to the
              lower cost of gold and other alloy metals used.
            </li>
            <li>
              Platinum: It tends to be more expensive than white gold because
              of its rarity, purity, and the labor-intensive process involved in
              crafting platinum jewelry.
