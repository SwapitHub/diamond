            Lifetime Manufacturing Warranty: Engagement Rings & Wedding Bands
          </p>

          <p>
            SAMA assures the quality and craftsmanship of our engagement rings
            and wedding bands by offering a free lifetime warranty against
            manufacturing defects. If you believe your purchase is damaged due
            to manufacturing, you can send it to us for inspection. Email
            hello@sama.com with photos, a short video, and a description of how
            the damage occurred. Before shipping your item back to SAMA, a 50
            USD deposit, covering the cost of shipping and an inspection by our
            jewelers to determine if the damage is warrantied, will be taken. If
            a warranty issue is found, SAMA will repair the warrantied damage or
            replace the item without charge and the deposit will be returned to
            the customer. Replacements are considered a one-time courtesy.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the assessed damage is not deemed a manufacturing defect and is
            repairable, SAMA will send the customer a quote to repair the
            jewelry. If the customer approves the quote, the deposit will be
            applied to the repair. If the customer decides not to have SAMA
            repair the item, the deposit will be returned to the customer along
            with the item free of charge. As each ring is made-to-order, slight
            variations should be expected and considered a defect.
          </p>

          <p>
            NOTE: Any repairs or services performed by a jeweler other than SAMA
            will void the warranty. The warranty also excludes replacing lost
            center stones, lost product, theft, or normal wear and tear. Prongs
            catching, wearing out, or bending can occur from everyday wear and
            lead to gemstones falling out. To ensure the integrity of your
            jewelry, repairing jewelry due to wear and tear is recommended.
            Discoloration of precious metals may also occur from chemicals or
            make-up during everyday activities such swimming, applying make-up,
            or cleaning. The SAMA warranty only applies to purchases from
            rockSAMA.com.

                  Proper storage and handling of the ring. Failure to properly
                  store the ring alone in a jewelry box or immersing jewelry
                  into harsh chemicals while cleaning or wearing the ring will
                  void the warranty.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Avoid exposing the ring or diamond to extreme force or harsh
                  conditions.

                  The warranty is non-transferrable and must be in the
                  possession of the purchaser to qualify.
